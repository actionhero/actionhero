<h1>ActionHero</h1>\nI am a flat file being served to you via the API from ./public/simple.html<br />
```

ActionHero comes with a file server which clients can make use of to request files on the ActionHero server. ActionHero is not meant to be a 'rendering' server (like express or rails), but can serve static files.

If a directory is requested rather than a file, ActionHero will look for the file in that directory defined by `api.config.commonWeb.directoryFileType` (which defaults to `index.html`). Failing to find this file, an error will be returned defined in `api.config.general.flatFileIndexPageNotFoundMessage`

You can use the `api.staticFile.get(connection, next)` in your actions (where `next(connection, error, fileStream, mime, length)`). Note that fileStream is a stream which can be pipe'd to a client. You can use this in actions if you wish,

On .nix operating system's symlinks for both files and folders will be followed.

## Web Clients

*   `Cache-Control` and `Expires` or respectively `ETag` headers (depending on configuration) will be sent with it's caching or revalidation time defined by `api.config.servers.web.flatFileCacheDuration`
*   Content-Types for files will attempt to be determined using the [mime package](https://npmjs.org/package/mime)
*   web clients may request `connection.params.file` directly within an action which makes use of `api.sendFile`, or if they are under the `api.config.servers.web.urlPathForFiles` route, the file will be looked up as if the route matches the directory structure under `flatFileDirectory`.
*   if your action wants to send content down to a client directly, you will do so like this `server.sendFile(connection, null, stream, 'text/html', length);`

## Non-web Clients

*   the param `file` should be used to request a path
*   file data is sent `raw`, and is likely to contain binary content and line breaks. Parse your responses accordingly!

## Files From Actions

```js
// success case
data.connection.sendFile('/path/to/file.mp3');
data.toRender = false;
next();

// failure case
data.connection.rawConnection.responseHttpCode = 404;
data.connection.sendFile('404.html');
data.toRender = false;
next();
```

You can send files from within actions using `connection.sendFile()`.

Note that you can optionally modify responseCodes (for HTTP clients only). Be sure to set `toRender = false` in the callback, as you have already sent data to the client, and probably don't want to do so again on a file request. If you try to `sendFile` on a path that doesn't exist (within your public directory), the 404 header will be handled automatically for you.

## Customizing

```js
// in an initializer, override api.staticFile.path

api.staticFile.path = function(connection){
  if(connection.action == 'sendFile'){
    return '/tmp/uploads';
  }else{
    return api.config.general.paths.public[0];
  }
}
```

By default, we want ActionHero's file server to be very locked-down, and only serve files from directories defined in `api.config.general.paths.public`. This is the safest default for beginners. However, you can customize things by changing the behavior of `api.staticFile.path()`.

This would serve files from `/public` for all requests except the `sendFile` action, which will serve files from `/tmp`
