# Cache

## General Cache Notes

actionhero ships with the functions needed for a distributed key-value cache.  You can cache strings, numbers, arrays and objects (anything that responds to `JSON.stringify`).  

The cache's redis server is defined by `api.config.redis`.  Note that if `api.config.redis.fake = true`, you will be using an in-memory redis server rather than a real redis process.

## Cache Methods

### api.cache.save

* Invoke: `api.cache.save(key, value, expireTimeMS, next)`
	* `expireTimeMS` can be null if you never want the object to expire 
* Callback: `next(error, new)`
	* `error` will be null unless the object can't be saved (perhaps out of ram or a bad object type).
	* overwriting an existing object will return `new = true`
	
`api.cache.save` is used to both create new entires or update existing cache entires.  If you don't define an expireTimeMS, `null` will be assumed, and using `null` will cause this cached item to never expire.  Expired cache objects will be periodically swept away (but not necessarily exactly when they expire)

### api.cache.load

* Invoke: `api.cache.load(key, next)` or `api.cache.load(key, options, next)`
	* `options` can be `{expireTimeMS: 1234}` where the act of reading the key will reset the key's expire time
	* If the requested `key` is not found (or is expired), all values returned will be null.
* Callback: `next(error, value, expireTimestamp, createdAt, readAt)`
	* `value` will be the object which was saved and `null` if the object cannot be found or is expired
	* `expireTimestamp` (ms) is when the object is set to expire in system time
	* `createdAt` (ms) is when the object was created
	* `readAt` (ms) is the timestamp at which the object was last read with `api.cache.load`.  Useful for telling if another worker has consumed the object recently

### api.cache.destroy

## Lock Methods

You may optionally implement locking methods along with your cache objects.  This will allow one actionhero server to obtain a lock on an object and prevent modification of it by another member of the cluster.  For example you may want to first `api.cache.lock` a key, and then save it to prevent other nodes from modifying the object. 

### api.cache.lock

* Invoke: `api.cache.save(key, expireTimeMS, next)`
  * `expireTimeMS` is optional, and will be `expireTimeMS = api.cache.lockDuration = api.config.general.lockDuration`
* Callback: `next(error, lockOk)`
  * `error` will be null unless there was something wrong with the connection (perhaps a redis error)
  * `lockOk` will be `true` or `false` depending on if the lock was obtained.

### api.cache.unlock

* Invoke: `api.cache.save(key, next)`
* Callback: `next(error, lockOk)`
  * `error` will be null unless there was something wrong with the connection (perhaps a redis error)
  * `lockOk` will be `true` or `false` depending on if the lock was removed.

### api.cache.checkLock

* Invoke: `api.cache.save(key,retry,  next)`
  * `retry` is either `null` or an integer (ms) that we should keep retrying until the lock is free to be re-obtained
* Callback: `next(error, lockOk)`
  * `error` will be null unless there was something wrong with the connection (perhaps a redis error)
  * `lockOk` will be `true` or `false` depending on if the lock is currently obtainable.

### api.cache.locks
* Invoke: `api.cache.save()`
* Callback: `next(error, locks)`
	* `locks` is an array of all currently active locks


* Invoke: `api.cache.destroy(key)`
* Callback: `next(error)`
	* will be false if the object cannot be found, and true if destroyed
	
You can see an example of using the cache within an action in [actions/cacheTest.js](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero/blob/master/actions/cacheTest.js)

## Redis

The timestamps regarding `api.cache.load` are to help clients understand if they are working with data which has been modified by another peer (when running in a cluster).

Keep in mind that many clients/servers can access a cached value simultaneously, so build your actions carefully not to have conflicting state, or use the locking methods.
