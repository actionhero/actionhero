  <p>ActionHero uses Primus to provided a robust and reliable nodejs websocket implementation. ActionHero web socket clients can fall back to long-polling and other transports to ensure they are connected. Primus allows you to choose the underlying websocket implementation of your choice.</p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
var A = new ActionheroClient;
A.connect();
A.action("actionsView", function(data){ console.log(data); })
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>ActionHero ships with the ability to be a line TCP or TLS server. ActionHero clients can speak a wire protocol that sends lines of JSON. Actions can be processed asynchronously and in parallel. The API server and the built-in chat system provide all you need for a communication or game application.</p>

  {% highlight bash %}
> telnet localhost 5000
Trying 127.0.0.1...

{"welcome":"Hello! Welcome to the actionhero api"}
> say myChatRoom hello
{"ok"}
