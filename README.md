## Who is the Actionhero?

Actionhero is a multi-transport API Server with integrated cluster capabilities and delayed tasks. The goal of actionhero is to create an easy-to-use toolkit for making **reusable** & **scalable** APIs for HTTP, WebSockets, and more. Clients connected to an actionhero server can [**consume the api**](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/actions), [**consume static content**](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/file-server), and [**communicate with each other**](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/chat). Actionhero is cluster-ready, with built in support for background tasks, 0-downtime deploys, and more. Actionhero provides a simple Async/Await API for managing every type of connection and background task.

Currently actionhero supports the following out of the box...

- [Web Clients](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/web-server): HTTP, HTTPS
- [Web Socket Clients](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/websocket-server): HTTP, HTTPS

[... and you can also make your own servers and transports.](https://www.actionherojs.com/tutorials/servers)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate a new Project
npx actionhero generate
npm install
npm run build # <--- new! I compile the TS to JS
npm run dev # <--- new! I use `ts-node` to let you develop on your ts files without compiling

# Use the actionhero CLI
(npx) actionhero generate action --name my_action
(npx) actionhero generate task --name my_task --queue default --frequency 0

# Test
npm test
# I'll run `prettier` and `build` for you first
# I handle .ts files now!

# To deploy your app
npm run build # <--- new! I compile the TS to JS
npm run start
```

Your new project will come with example actions, tests, and more.
